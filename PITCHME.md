### Why am I start working on it?

```
> k get po --no-headers=true --all-namespaces | wc -l #630

> k get ns --no-headers | wc -l #31

> gcloud container clusters list | wc -l #8
```
---
## Cluster != Environment

> Computer cluster - set of loosely or tightly connected computers that work together

> Environment - represents the association between variable names and data types.

## DRY Principle
- .circleci/config.yaml
- Makefile
- Dockerfile
---
## All like a code
- Infrastructure as code
- Documentation as code
- Configuration as code
- Diagram as code
- Slides as code
